REPORT RELATED TO THE TASK COVERED IN THE WHOLE MONTH
#  Work completed so far :
To capture and inspect data travelling over the website like Instagram and facebook we use a network sniffer that’s why I install scapy  in my terminal ,before installling it I have install Ubuntu for windows subsystem for linux for writing code in python and also download python then after the scapy, I have made the system that run in two different terminal and captures data and also store it in the terminal but in the same laptop.
# Challenges Faced :
Since the task is of developing malware ,There are not much(tends to zero) reference videos so that I can make an idea of how to deploy a malware.Thats why It become very hard for me to deploy that malware in another laptop due to some network firewall function which checks that in initial stage.
Also the resource given are not so precise i.e. they have very much information that I take more time as expected to gather the required malware developing information and until the day I am writing this report I only get very few information about how it works and its function which I give detail in next part;
